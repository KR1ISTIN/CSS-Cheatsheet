# CSS-Cheatsheet

## Description

This CSS Cheat Sheet Project was to create a useful resource when needing to recall some basic usage of Flexbox, Grid, and Columns, along with a few CSS style properties to help develop your project. This project allowed me to improve my knowledge when working with Flexbox to create columns and enhancing the design with a linear-gradient and hover pseudo-class. I look foward to furthering my knowledge with CSS Flexbox, Grids, and Columns amongst many more styles in my future projects.
